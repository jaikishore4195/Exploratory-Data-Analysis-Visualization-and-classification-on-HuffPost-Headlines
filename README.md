# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-classification-on-HuffPost-Headlines

Project Introduction:
Did exploratory Analysis on HuffPost dataset and then built 1-gram and bi-grams tfidf matrix and built statistical and Neural net models

Model use case in Industry:
As every organization has internal documents which belong to different teams, so this model can be used to classify articles from different teams or classify articles by topic.

Model performance:
Tested this model on test data and the number of classes being 31 the model was performing with a multi-class accuracy of 48 percent.
